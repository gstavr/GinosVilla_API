# Building RESTful Web APIs with Authentication: Tech Stack Overview

In this Udemy course, we leverage a robust tech stack to build RESTful web APIs with authentication using C# and .NET 7. Below is an overview of the technologies and tools employed throughout the course:

## C# Programming Language

C# is a powerful, modern programming language developed by Microsoft. It is widely used for building various types of applications, including web, desktop, mobile, and cloud-based solutions. In this course, we harness the features and capabilities of C# to implement business logic, data manipulation, and API endpoints.

## .NET 7 Framework

.NET is a cross-platform framework for building different types of applications, including web APIs. With .NET 7, the latest version at the time of this course, we leverage cutting-edge features and improvements for enhanced performance, productivity, and security. .NET 7 provides a robust foundation for developing scalable and maintainable APIs.

## ASP.NET Core

ASP.NET Core is an open-source, cross-platform framework for building modern web applications and services with .NET. It provides a unified programming model for developing web APIs, MVC applications, and SignalR hubs. In this course, we utilize ASP.NET Core to create RESTful API endpoints, handle HTTP requests and responses, and implement authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Entity Framework Core

Entity Framework Core is an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework provided by Microsoft. It simplifies data access and manipulation by enabling developers to work with databases using .NET objects. With Entity Framework Core, we seamlessly integrate our API with a relational database, allowing for efficient CRUD operations and data persistence.

## JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims securely between two parties. In our course, we employ JWT as the authentication mechanism for securing our API endpoints. JWT provides a stateless solution for authentication, enabling clients to access protected resources by presenting a digitally signed token.

## Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code are integrated development environments (IDEs) provided by Microsoft. They offer powerful features for writing, debugging, and testing C# and .NET applications. Throughout the course, we utilize Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code as our primary development tools for building and debugging our RESTful API.

## Git and GitHub

Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. GitHub is a web-based platform for hosting Git repositories and collaborating on projects. We leverage Git and GitHub to manage our codebase, track changes, and collaborate with other developers (optional).

## Docker (optional)

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers provide a lightweight, portable environment for deploying applications consistently across different environments. In our course, we may explore Docker as an optional tool for containerizing our API and simplifying deployment.

## Conclusion

By leveraging this comprehensive tech stack, you'll gain valuable experience and skills in building secure, scalable, and maintainable RESTful web APIs with authentication using C# and .NET 7. Let's embark on this journey together and unlock the full potential of modern web development!
